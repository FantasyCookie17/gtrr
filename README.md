## Contributing guidelines
* You may use both English and/or the native language of the country.
* Put things into the appropriate path, e.g. `country/region/city/` or `country/`.
* When linking to things, use absolute paths, not relative paths.
* Don't be a bigot; don't spread hate. Try to follow the [mode of conduct](https://fantasycookie17.cf/coc.html). Note: it contains some things specific to chatrooms on Matrix; these can be safely ignored.
